# CTA_Flasher

Arduino board package for the CTA Flasher. Based extensively on the Arduino Zero, tweaked to make the five SPI SERCOMs more accessible.

Open the Arduino IDE Preferences (under the File menu) and add this line to the Additional Boards Manager URLs:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulZC/CTA_Flasher/master/package_PAULZC_FLASHER_index.json

Use the Boards Manager to install the **Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+)** boards first.

Open the board manager and enter "flasher" into the search box. Install the "Flasher Board - based on Arduino Zero by PaulZC" board package to provide support for the CTA Flasher.
